# Bash Script for Organizing Files into Directories Based on File Type

This script organizes files in a specified directory into three categories: Documents, Images, and Others. It checks if the directories exist and creates them if necessary. Then, it moves files into the appropriate directories based on their file extensions.

## Script


# Get the directory path as a command line argument


# Define paths for different categories

# Check if directories exist; if not, create them

# Loop through each file in the directory and organize them
