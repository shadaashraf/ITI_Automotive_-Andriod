# Bash Scripting Task: File Organizer

### Objective: 
 Create a Bash script that organizes files from a source directory into subdirectories based on their file types.
###  Requirements:
 **1.** The script should accept a single argument which is the source directory containing the files to be organized.
 
 **2.** .It should create subdirectories (images, documents, others) within the source directory.
 
  **3.** Files should be categorized based on their types: • Images: Files with extensions .jpg, .png, .gif • Documents: Files with extensions .txt, .doc, .pdf • Others: Files with any other extensions
  
   **4.** Each file should be moved from the source directory to the appropriate subdirectory based on its type.
   
   **5.** Ensure the script handles edge cases like files without extensions or unknown file types appropriately.
